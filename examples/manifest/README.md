## fog05 Examples manifests

Here you can find a bunch of manifest that can be useful to learn how to build your own manifest for onboarding an 
entity or an application using fog05.

You can check if a manifest is correct by using the fos2 cli interface

    $ fos2 manifest [-e | -n | -a] <path_to_manifest>

Where -e stands for entity, to check if an entity manifest is correct
Where -n stands for network, to check if a network manifest is correct
Where -a stands for application, to check if a application manifest is correct
